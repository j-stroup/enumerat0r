Target enumeration tool for bug bounties and pentests.

***

The idea is to build multiple tools which can function
independently or concurrently from main.py. Each tool
will focus on a different field of enumeration such as
parsing robots.txt, fuzzing for common subdomains, and
crawling the target for all discoverable endpoints.

***

Eventually I'd like to tie all of the tools together
and display the resulting endpoints as a webpage. I
also want to offer a customized headers option for
bug bounty programs that require it.

***

To-do:
  Only log endpoints not already logged
  Add robots results to crawler
  Select tools to run from main.py
  Additional fuzzing for common directories and php/txt files
  Make list of URLs with parameters
  Convert all results into webpage
  Parse js files for goodies
