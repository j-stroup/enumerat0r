Target enumeration tool for bug bounties and pentests.

The idea is to build multiple tools which can function
independently or concurrently from main.py. Each tool
will focus on a different field of enumeration such as
parsing robots.txt, fuzzing for common subdomains, and
crawling the target for all discoverable endpoints.

Eventually I'd like to tie all of the tools together
and display the resulting endpoints as a webpage. I
also want to offer a customized headers option for
bug bounty programs that require it.
